This is a [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

Nest is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications. It uses modern JavaScript, is built with TypeScript and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

Some key features of App:

- Authentication
